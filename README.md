kubz is a project designed to harness distributed zero-knowledge machine learning (DzkML) to ensure secure, verifiable AI across decentralized networks. Our system converts AI models into unique digital fingerprints—proofs that validate the model's inference process, ensuring both integrity and performance.

## Architecture Overview


### Miners and Validators

#### Incentive and Reward System

kubz introduces an innovative reward mechanism that:
- **Scores Predictions**: Rewards miners based on the cryptographic integrity of the generated zk-proofs and the efficiency of inference.
- **Validates Inference**: Uses validators to confirm that each miner’s zk-proof accurately corresponds to the AI model’s output.
- **Balances Workloads**: Allows participation from both GPU and non-GPU nodes while pushing for GPU-optimized proving systems over time.

#### Roles

- **Miners**
  - Receive input data from validators.
  - Run zkML models to generate a witness and produce zero-knowledge proofs.
  - Return both the witness and its verification proof for validation.

- **Validators**
  - Distribute data and requests to miners.
  - Verify the authenticity and integrity of each miner’s output through zk-proofs.
  - Score miners based on performance metrics such as proof size and response time.
