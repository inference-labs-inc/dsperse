# Dsperse: Distributed zkML

## Overview

Dsperse is a toolkit for slicing, analyzing, and running neural network models. It supports ONNX models, allowing you to break down complex models into smaller segments for detailed analysis, optimization, and verification.

### Core Purpose
The project aims to solve a significant challenge in zkML (zero-knowledge machine learning) by introducing a distributed approach to proof computation and providing tools for model slicing and analysis.

### Key Technical Innovation
The main innovation is the concept of "model slicing" where:
1. Instead of processing an entire neural network at once
2. The system splits the neural network into manageable segments
3. Each segment can be processed independently for analysis, inference, or proof generation

### Primary Goals
1. **Model Slicing**
    - Split neural network models into individual layers or custom segments
    - Support ONNX models
    - Enable detailed analysis of model components

2. **Distributed Computation**
    - Break down large ML models into manageable pieces
    - Enable parallel processing across multiple machines
    - Support both GPU and non-GPU nodes

3. **Resource Optimization**
    - Reduce RAM requirements through model splitting
    - Implement efficient inference pipelines
    - Better manage compute resources

4. **System Flexibility**
    - Support for different model types
    - Configurable slicing strategies
    - Adaptable to different hardware capabilities

5. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**
    - Generate proofs for model execution via ezkl integration
    - Support for both whole model and sliced model proofs
    - Optimize proof generation for distributed environments

### Implementation Framework
- Built on top of existing tools:
    - ONNX for model representation and interoperability
    - ezkl for zero-knowledge proof generation
    - Halo 2 as the underlying proving system

- Comprehensive CLI interface for:
    - Model slicing
    - Inference
    - Proof generation
    - Proof verification

- Designed to work with various neural network architectures
- Focuses on practical applications of zkML technology
